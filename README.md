Local Art Gallery

In this project, I am excited to take on the challenge of creating a curated digital form of abstract art for a local art gallery. The gallery has specified that the piece must use grid or flex, utilize three types of CSS units, and be responsive across various screen sizes. Additionally, I am required to implement z-index and hierarchical selectors, use common shorthands, and add an HTML form to collect visitor information. With these requirements in mind, I am eager to showcase my skills and create a visually stunning piece that will captivate both in-person and virtual visitors to the gallery.
